# Satya Nagara

System-first interface engineer focused on clarity, performance, and real-world constraints.

## Principles

**Constraint-driven design**  
Better interfaces emerge from working within limits—bandwidth, attention, capability.

**System thinking over components**  
Interfaces are consequences of system behavior. Design from architecture out.

**Production awareness**  
Code runs in environments with failure modes, edge cases, and real users.

**Minimal viable surface**  
Remove until nothing remains that can be removed.

## Work

[**interface-systems**](interface-systems/)  
Portfolio demonstrating interface architecture using pure HTML and CSS.

[**interface-experiments**](interface-experiments/)  
Focused explorations of specific interface patterns and interactions.

[**system-design-notes**](system-design-notes/)  
Technical writing on interface philosophy and system constraints.

[**frontend-standards**](frontend-standards/)  
Opinionated engineering guidelines for production interfaces.
