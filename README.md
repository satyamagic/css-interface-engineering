# Satya Nagara

System-first interface engineer focused on clarity, performance, and real-world constraints.

## Principles

**Constraint-driven design**  
Better interfaces emerge from working within limits—bandwidth, attention, capability.

**System thinking over components**  
Interfaces are consequences of system behavior. Design from architecture out.

**Production awareness**  
Code runs in environments with failure modes, edge cases, and real users.

**Minimal viable surface**  
Remove until nothing remains that can be removed.
