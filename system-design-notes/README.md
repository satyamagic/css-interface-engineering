# System Design Notes

Technical writing on interface philosophy and system constraints.

## Purpose

Document thinking on interface architecture, system behavior, and design constraints.

Not best practices. Not definitive answers. Explorations of problems, tradeoffs, and contextual decisions.

## Content

### Offline-First UI
How interface architecture changes when network connectivity is unreliable or absent.

### HUD Information Hierarchy
Principles for organizing high-density information displays where spatial consistency matters.

### Designing for Low-Light
Interface considerations when users operate in dark environments or at night.

### Failure-Aware Interfaces
Designing systems that expect and communicate failure states effectively.

## Approach

Each article:
- Defines the problem space
- Examines constraints
- Explores tradeoffs
- Provides technical reasoning

1-2 pages. No fluff. Clear thinking.

## Topics Covered

- Network constraints and offline behavior
- Visual hierarchy in information-dense interfaces
- Environmental context and lighting conditions
- Failure modes and system resilience
- State management and user expectations

---

Good design emerges from understanding constraints, not ignoring them.
